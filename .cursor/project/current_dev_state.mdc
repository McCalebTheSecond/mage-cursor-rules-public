# Current Development State

## Instructions for Cursor LLM/agent:
- Keep this file `.cursor/rules/project/current_dev_state.mdc` up to date.

## Active Work
Following `DEV/project_estimation_plan.md` to build Project Estimation data mart in dbt.

## Currently Working On
**Verifying Plan Completion**: Working through `DEV/project_estimation_plan.md` to validate that checked `[x]` items are actually complete and correct.

## Recently Completed ✅
- **Source Table Identification & Cleanup**: Simplified user model by removing `res_users` tables
- **User Model Simplification**: Now using `hr_employee.user_id` for all user relationships
- **Sources Configuration**: Updated `sources.yml` with 14 final source tables (removed 2 user-related tables)
- **Schema Cleanup**: Updated relationship tests to point to `hr_employee` instead of `res_users`
- **Staging Models**: Cleaned up unnecessary user staging models

## Previously Completed
- Phase 1: dbt setup, sources configuration ✓
- Phase 2: Most staging models completed ✓
- Basic Mage pipeline `dbt_project_estimation_dev` created ✓

## Next Up (After Plan Verification)
- Complete remaining staging models:
  - `stg_odoo__project_stage_tag.sql` 
  - `stg_odoo__project_stage_project_stage_tag_rel.sql`
- Create missing macros (`cast_and_rename`, `format_date_to_key`)
- Set up source freshness monitoring

## In Progress/Upcoming
- Phase 3: Dimension models (snapshots + views)
- Phase 4: Fact table `fct_project_estimates`

## Key Models Status
- **Sources**: 14 tables configured in `sources.yml` ✓
- **Staging**: 13+ models in `models/staging/odoo/` (2 project stage tag models remaining)
- **Marts**: Not yet started (`models/marts/core/` empty)
- **Snapshots**: Not yet created (`snapshots/` empty)
- **Macros**: Need to create utility macros in `macros/`

## Current Git State
- **Branch**: `chore/dbt_project_estimation/validate-completed-plan-items`
- **Last Commit**: `06a426a` - User model simplification
