# dbt Miscellaneous Setup

## Project & Profile

-   **dbt Project Name:** `dw` (Located in the `dbt/dw/` directory relative to the project root)
-   **dbt Profile Name:** `dw` (Defined in `dbt/dw/profiles.yml`)

## Environments

We utilize a standard multi-environment setup targeting BigQuery:

-   **Development (`dev`):**
    -   **BigQuery Project:** Use `${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}` environment variable
    -   **BigQuery Dataset:** `dev`
    -   **Target:** `--target dev`
    -   **Purpose:** Local development, testing new models, iterative work. Developers should primarily use this target.
-   **Staging (`staging`):**
    -   **BigQuery Project:** Use `${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}` environment variable
    -   **BigQuery Dataset:** `staging`
    -   **Target:** `--target staging`
    -   **Purpose:** Pre-production testing, CI/CD validation. Aims to mirror production closely.
-   **Production (`prod`):**
    -   **BigQuery Project:** Use `${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}` environment variable
    -   **BigQuery Dataset:** `prod`
    -   **Target:** `--target prod`
    -   **Purpose:** Final, trusted data models consumed by BI tools (Power BI) and other applications. Runs are typically scheduled via Mage deployment pipelines.

## Credentials

-   Authentication uses a service account keyfile or Application Default Credentials.
-   **Keyfile Path:** Use `${GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS}` environment variable (This path is relative to the environment where dbt runs).

## Modeling Layers (Medallion Architecture)

We aim to follow the Bronze, Silver, Gold modeling pattern as the project develops:

-   **Bronze (Staging):** Intended for raw data ingestion with minimal transformations (e.g., create models in `models/staging`). These models will read from sources defined in `.yml` files.
-   **Silver (Intermediate):** Planned for cleansed, integrated, and conformed data (e.g., create models in `models/intermediate`). These will build foundational tables like dimensions and facts, reading from Bronze models.
-   **Gold (Marts):** Designed for aggregated, business-centric datasets optimized for reporting and analysis (e.g., create models in `models/marts`). These will read from Silver models and serve BI tools like Power BI.

## Key Files & Directories

-   **Project Configuration:** `dbt/dw/dbt_project.yml`
-   **Profile Configuration:** `dbt/dw/profiles.yml` (Note: This file contains secrets and might be managed differently in production, potentially via Mage's `io_config.yaml`).
-   **Models:** `dbt/dw/models/` (Organized into subdirectories like `staging`, `intermediate`, `marts`)
-   **Sources:** Defined in `.yml` files, typically within `dbt/dw/models/`
-   **Tests:** Defined in `.yml` files alongside models or in `dbt/dw/tests/`
