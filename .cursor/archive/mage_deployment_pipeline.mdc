Assessment: NOT RELEVANT for your project
Recommendation: Remove this rule file entirely
Why it's not relevant:
You're using Mage.ai Pro (SaaS) - You don't deploy or manage Mage infrastructure. Mage.ai handles all the deployment, scaling, and infrastructure for you.
Wrong focus area - Your current work is:
Building dbt models for data transformation
Creating data pipelines within Mage
Project estimation analytics
BigQuery data warehousing
Takes up valuable context space - This detailed deployment template uses context that would be better spent on:
Your dbt model structure
Current development progress
Data transformation patterns
Business logic for project estimation
Potentially confusing - Having deployment infrastructure details might mislead future LLM conversations into thinking you need to manage Mage infrastructure.
What to do instead:
Delete mage_deployment_pipeline.mdc and focus your Cursor rules on what actually matters for your project:
dbt development patterns
Data modeling conventions
Project estimation business logic
Mage pipeline orchestration (not deployment)
BigQuery optimization
Current development state
Your other rules like mage_misc.mdc, dbt_misc.mdc, and development-workflow.mdc are much more valuable because they relate to your actual daily work.
Simple rule: If you haven't used it in the last month and won't use it in the next 3 months, remove it from context.
